\begin{abstract}
We present \projectName{}, a nail augmented device that sense user's fingernail contour and bend when force is applied on surface. By using 3$\times$3 array of 0.2mm strain gauges, \projectName{} is small enough to fit on fingernail, and it is flexible and stretchable.
We evaluate this interface in motion and motionless mode. The system can distinguish swipe gestures with high accuracy(93.2\%). For motionless mode, it can achieved 85.6\% accuracy for classifying with different kinds of finger posture.
Since the device is always available input, it allows user to perform swipe gestures on surfaces around or touch postures on touch screen devices to enable different kinds of application usage.
We also show some examples applications such as quickly swipe on surfaces around to control smart TV or touching on touchscreen devices to enable different application short cuts.

\section{Introduction}
Recent works has seen new proposal for nail augmented device in body-attach computing. Fingernail has been widely adopt due to its characteristic of non-perception area. And it also has the advantages of its non-obstructive and most promising place for easy installation and removing\cite{MagNail}. Moreover, nail art is proposed in previous work\cite{NailDisplay,NailO}. We believe that using nail as mounted location will become more popular in the future.

% These devices are designed to be non-obstructive, small, lightweight and no disturbing in daily life. 

% In order to increase touch screen mobility, nail is the place which widely adopted for input due to its no proprioception area. Furthermore, it is less disturbing and most promising place due to easy installation and removing\cite{MagNail}. Lastly, nail art is proposed in previous work\cite{NailDisplay,NailO}. 
% In our daily life, we use our fingertips for controlling smart devices and feeling the tactile feedback from surface. Upon on this, flat and smooth touchscreen has been proposed and widely adopted by users. However, touchscreen are not always available device and at most of the device can only have binary states for touching. 
% Fingernail has multiple advantages for body mounted-device.


% 一開始講在nail上面output的work
% 在結尾開始講在nail上面做input的work
Early works on fingernail mounted devices developed schemes to augment fingernail with a output of display and sensor. NailDisplay\cite{NailDisplay} tried to mounted a visual display on top of fingernail to avoid the big thumb problem on touchscreen. Ando et al.\cite{NailTDisplay} proposed to put a small voice coil to control the tactile feedback from surface by changing waveforms. More than that, FingerSight\cite{FingerSight} implemented a device consisted with camera to extract the information from the surrounding. Previous research also demonstrated using nail-mounted device to enrich input area. NailO\cite{NailO} proposed a capacitive sensor grid on top of the fingernail to sense swipe and tap gestures.
uTrack\cite{uTrack} and FingerPad\cite{FingerPad} 
added on the fingertip with a small magnet, and using a magnetic field tracks the finger movement. TouchSense\cite{TouchSense} used 3-axis accelerometer to detect finger postures to switch different modes of input.
These works has proved that the device on top of fingernail's advantages. However, these works only instrument the device on top of the fingernail without using the characteristic of fingernail itself.

% 以下開始討論用指甲本身的特性 像是顏色改變
This brings us to think about using fingernail as a input property proposed in \cite{NailSense}, which used a computer vision for sensing force touch.
There are also works using fingernail itself as a sensing part. Mascaro et al.\cite{Photoplethysmograph} also implemented a nail-mounted device for observing changes in the reflection intensity on fingernail. (one more work!) However, the sensing technique of it still left in question for recognition of swiping gestures and it also is limited to sense a force which is not enough for out daily use.
% TODO 這邊可能要改!!

In order to explore better sensing technique of nail augmented device, we aimed to design a device that achieved following designs. First, it has the ability of sensing simple gestures on surface like swiping and tapping. Second, it has no restrictions of input area which can enable user to perform gestures on surfaces around. Finally, it should comes with light and thin form factor due to the place of fingernail.
The proposed design will definitely be a novel input device for increasing the mobility of touch screen. It also can be perform gestures anywhere without physical effort.

In this paper, we developed a prototype, \projectName{} (\autoref{fig:FIGURE1}), use a 3$\times$3 array of strain gauges sensor to explore the strains from fingernail as input technique.

% 指甲擁有了
% Using body parts as an input sensing technique becomes popular research area in HCI community recently. It not only provides users control surroundings by simply performing intuitively gestures, but also comes as an always-available input device which lowers physical effort when user needed.
% Since the device is mounted to our body, it is important to be attentive for the comfort level which will determines the utility of the device.
% Many form factor of sensing technique are presented (e.g. wristwatches, rings, bends). However, using fingers to perform gesture on surface is already built in our daily life which is widely adopted by users and it is the most intuitive way to perform gestures.



% In this paper, we chose the fingernail as a input area which has no proprioception and the device on top of it can be easily forgotten by user. Furthermore, it is less disturbing and most promising place due to easy installation and removing\cite{MagNail}. Lastly, nail art is proposed in previous work, Kao et al.\cite{NailO} implemented a nail-mounted device to sense swipe gestures on top of fingernail with decorations at top layer.

% Previous research also demonstrated using nail-mounted device to explore new interactions. Hwang et al.\cite{NailSense} proposed a technique which senses the force pressure by detecting white region of fingernail using computer vision. Kadomura et al.\cite{MagNail} also used a magnet on top of finger to enable interaction nearby smart devices with magnet sensor. TouchSense\cite{TouchSense} used 3-axis accelerometer to detect finger postures to switch different modes of input. TapSense\cite{TapSense} use a acoustic way to identify the gestures that drawing on the wall.
% However, the interaction of the techniques are limited to particular sensing area such as the region that can sense touch or within camera site.

% There are also works to track 2d on surface. LightRing\cite{LightRing} used a infrared proximity sensor and gyroscope to track finger movement. FingerPad\cite{FingerPad} and uTrack\cite{uTrack} instrument the fingertip with a small (passive) magnet, and a second finger with an active device that tracks the finger by magnetic field changes. Althought these device are

% The proposed technique will definitely be helpful in enhancing the modality of finger interaction, and expanding the interaction space due to the gesture can be performed everywhere.(this should be changed as well because this is a copy from nailsense) Our prototype, \projectName{} (\autoref{fig:FIGURE1}), use a 3$\times$3 array of strain gauges sensor. The size of the device's height is 0.8cm and width is 1cm which is smaller than 1 cent of US dollar.
% Derived from NailO\cite{NailO}, we aimed to provide a technique that can sense a touch and swipe event on any surface around user, and explore a touch using strain features to distinguish different kinds of posture and swipe gestures. We implemented a nail-mounted device that can sense the slight strain changes from fingernail when finger touches the surface. By letting user perform gesture on surface, user can perform gesture more intuitively.

% Products such as nail art stickers and fake eyelashes are widely accepted as extensions to the body for decoration and self-expression. They seamlessly blend into our physical bodies when attached, and are easily removable. As people already wear these products for fashion purposes, we propose embedding technology into these products to extend their functionality and utility to interaction.
% To afford usability in the form of cosmetic extensions, three main design themes must be realized: First, the interface should be small and unobtrusive. It should be designed with technology that can be miniaturized to the size of cosmetic products. When worn, it should be comfortable to an extent its existence could be forgotten. Second, the interface should afford natural interactions. The interactions should be simple, intuitive and require minimal cognitive mapping, building on natural body gestures. Third, the interface should be appealing and easy to wear. Like clothing and accessories, the interface can be easily customized. The mounting and removal process should also be simple and similar to existing cosmetic processes. As no device exists that satisfies the above criteria, our work is motivated to do so.



%must have this!
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
 \begin{itemize} %placeholder for now
 \item A novel fingernail input interface presented and explores the ability of fingernail's strains as a input technique.
 \item We develop a nail-mounted prototype can detect swipe gestures and postures of fingernail.
 \item We conducted two system evaluations of this technique and implemented scenarios to explore interactions.
 \end{itemize}



% \section{Related Work}
% \subsection{Functional work}
% LightRing\cite{LightRing} provides an always-available 2D input on any surface. LightRing uses IR emmitter and gyroscope to acquire finger movements on any surface. IR emmitter is used for measuring the distance between the ring and the middle segment (middle phalanx) of the instrumented finger, and gyroscope is used for rotation rate. However, it need to correct for drift with a magnetometer for other longer interactions.
% \subsection{Camera Approches}
% NailSense\cite{NailSense} use camera to track the finger tip’s color change, and then guess user is performing the touch or released gestures (using OpenCV). The limitation is camera needed and the gestures need to be performed in front of it. AirPincher is a handheld device which provides eye-free input within fingers and support 6 kinds of gesture with tactile feedback. User can use his/her thumb to pinch, swipe, rubbing at index and middle finger, and the demo of surfing websites also proposed. Nevertheless, camera needed and need to hold the device, not always available.
% \subsection{Location work}
% MagNail\cite{MagNail} is a study that augmenting nails with a magnet to detect user actions using a smart device which allows user actions to be detected via the magnetic sensor integrated in smart devices such as a smartphone or a tablet PC. The limitation is the error rates is pretty high on the button of the device. NailO use capacitive sensing on printed electrodes as a input surface. It is small and unobtrusive, existence could be forgotten and it has a high accuracy. However, it can only support 5 kinds of gestures. 
% \subsection{Acoustic work}
% TapSense\cite{TapSense} use a acoustic way to identify which gesture is preformed by the users. They capture the sound when our fingers strike the screen, and use that sound pattern to recognize the gesture. This approach doesn't require user to wear anything, but will need a microphone which already built in smart phones. Scratch input use the sound when fingernail is dragged over the surface of a textured material as finger input surface. Six Scratch Input gestures at about 90\% accuracy with less than five minutes of training and on wide variety of surfaces. However, the interface table will not always exist.

\section{Prototype Design}
In order to design a nail augmented device to sense a touch or gesture on surfaces, we have few mainly requirements. First of all, the device must be small enough to fit within fingernail. Second, it should have ability of sensing slightly changes of the strain from fingernail. Last but not least, it has to be reusable and easy for installation and removing. Based on above of requirements, we derived that using a 2D array of 0.2mm strain gauges is the appropriate solution for this prototype.
\subsection{Pilot Study : Human Behaviour and Size of Fingernail}
Before developing device, we recruited 10 participants (7 male, 3 female) from ages 20 and 24 (mean 21.2) to find average width and height of fingernail. We also requested user to perform tap gesture on electronic load-cell to measure how much pressure applied on the surface in daily life for investigating the ability of strain gauges.
The result of this pilot study, fingernail width is 1.145cm(SD=0.14) and height is 1.21cm(SD=0.17). 
And the average of tap pressure measured 0.82N(SD=0.26).
% The changes of color on fingernail are obvious when we press pressure changes, 

% , trains from fingernail is 

% Physical changes on the surface of nail caused by finger motions and gestures on surface are visible to the human eye. However, there is still difficulty on detecting it through most sensing techniques because such physical changes are very small in comparison to that of finger joint movements. Moreover, physical changes on the surface of nail varies from person to person. Accordingly, we have two major requirements. First, a small and light device must be able to sense small physical changes. Second, a device must be able to extract individual information from multiple spots on the surface of a human nail. Among a variety of sensing techniques, we conclude that strain gauge sensors best fit our requirements for this prototype.

\subsection{Hardware}
% The device is height 0.8cm and width 1.0cm
We developed \projectName{} using a 3$\times$3 array of 120-ohm 0.2-mm strain gauges for sensing part (Shown in \autoref{fig:FIGURE1}). Below of the strain gauges, we used a stretchable and flexible artificial-skin to stick sensors on user's fingernail. The size of it only takes 0.9cm$\times$1cm which is smaller than 1 cent of US dollar, and the thickness of it is 1mm. Each of the strain gauge is directly wired to the computing part.
The computing hardware is consisted with an Arduino Nano board and two 8-to-1 analog switches(MAX4617, Maxim Integrated), a dual digital potentiometer (AD5231, Analog Devices), and two instrumental amplifiers (INA333 and INA122U, Analog Devices). 


The diagram of the computing hardware is shown in \autoref{fig:completeCircuitDiagram}. First, the multiplexers are sequentially selected to connect one of the strain gauges. Once one of the strain sensors is selected, it becomes one of the 4 resistors on the Wheatstone bridge. When the forces apply, the strain of fingernail let the sensor slight changed which caused the ohm value of strain gauges lower or higher. Due to the changes of ohm value, one side of the voltage in Wheatstone bridge also changed.

\begin{figure}[t!]

  \caption{The complete circuit diagram. Note that SG stands for strain gauge. The 24:1 analog multiplexer is practically made up of 3 analog multiplexers.}
  \label{fig:completeCircuitDiagram}
\end{figure}

Since the requirement of sensing the slightly change of the strain from fingernail, we used two amplifier to magnify the difference on the Wheatstone bridge 4000 times. Finally, Arduino Nano read the final analog value from the amplifier's output. For the digital potentiometer, it is used for adjusting the resistance to let the Wheatstone bridge have no difference on both side during calibration.

% Strain gauge sensors are sensitive devices used to measure very small strain and elongation of an object such as buildings, foundations, and other structures. In order to accomplish such measurement, a strain gauge must be adhesively attached to the object. Any tension or compression on the object leads to changes in the electrical resistance of the sensor.
% a figure here

% In our prototype, the sensing stage of our prototype consists of a reusable hydrogel-based artificial skin and 9 [120-ohm 2-mm] strain gauge sensors. The artificial skin is attached to the surface of nail and acts as a sensor carrier. As shown in, the sensors are distributed into a 3-by-3 grid configuration. The following sentences explain for such sensor layout. An average of human nail width is approximately [], and the base length of a [2-mm strain gauge is 6.3 mm]. In order to avoid physical contact between any two neighboring sensors causing strain interference, a spaced interval of [2 mm] separates them, resulting in 9 strain gauges in a 3-by-3 grid across the nail surface. The sensor array measures the deformations of multiple individual spots of the artificial skin caused by physical changes on the surface of nail. Thus, our prototype is made possible to become a finger gesture interface for general users.

% Next, the signal conditioning stage includes a Wheatstone bridge, 2 8-to-1 analog switches (MAX4617, Maxim Integrated), a dual digital potentiometer (MCP42X1, Microchip), and an instrumental amplifier (INA122U, Analog Devices). Finally, the processing stage includes an Arduino Nano used to sample the sensors and control chips in the signal conditioning stage. The complete circuit diagram is shown in \autoref{fig:completeCircuitDiagram} and a customized circuit board is shown in.



% The 9 sensors are read sequentially through the analog switches, so each sensor is electrically connected at a time. Once a sensor is active, the sensor became one of the 4 resistors on the Wheatstone bridge. Since the resistance of each sensor varies under no applied external force, a digital potentiometer in series with the connected sensor is used for calibration. Another digital potentiometer serves the purpose of amplifier gain adjustment. In our prototype, the instrumental amplifier gain is set to be approximately 500. Due to the dynamic response time of the amplifier, a [100-microsecond delay] is added between each reading leading to a sampling rate of 75 Hz for our prototype.

\subsection{Gesture / Posture Recognition}
We used LIBSVM tool\cite{libsvm}, a popular machine learning open-source library for SVM which is a way to distinguish the pattern by vectors.
Since the different of the input data sets, we implemented two algorithm specifically for swipe gestures (Motion mode) and finger posture (Motionless mode).
%which are sequentially and time based data
% which is a static raw data

In motion mode, sequentially and time based data is preprocessed by accumulate difference to the first data when the gesture begin. At the end, the sequentially data is processed to be one feature data.
In motionless mode, raw data is directly used for machine learning.
Finally, we scale each feature to the range of -1 to 1 and then train a multi-class SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

\section{System Evaluation}
The goal of the study is to explore whether the system is capable for classifying different kinds of swipe gestures and finger posture angles in different kinds of pressure level.

\subsection{Participants}
We recruited 10 participants (7 male, 3 female) between the ages of 20 and 23. All participants are right-handed and drew with their right index fingers on the surface. Each participants received \$5 after one hour experiment.
\subsection{Apparatus} %設備！
% TODO add Study one Figs
The apparatus is shown in Fig???. We used the load-cell which is the same in our pilot study. In this experiment, we put a 9DOF sensor on user's index finger, it is only used for checking whether user is performing the correct position and angle. The surface we used in our study is medium-density fibreboard.

\subsection{Task and Procedure}
% Participants were asked to reproduce a series of instructed angle \cite{UnderstandingTouch} and force between 0.6N(Newton) to 1.0N.
\subsubsection{Motion Mode}
We chose 8 direction as shown in Fig???. Users are requested to perform swipe gestures shown on computer screen and press space from the beginning and the end of the gesture. On the desk, we draw 8 direction of line to insure swipe angle is correct. Each direction are collect 10 sets of sequentially data which has total 80 gestures for each user. Before the study, a calibration is needed for the first time wearing, and no calibration within this study.

\subsubsection{Motionless Mode}
In each trail, the participants were instructed to adjust their finger pitch and roll angle which are selected from \cite{UnderstandingTouch}. We only chose some part of angle which are easy to identify for users.
The forces are chosen from our pilot user study which are chosen as average force(0.8N), one SD forces(0.6N, 1.0N), two SD forces(0.4N, 1.2N) as presented in Fig???. The participants are asked to straighten finger during all experiment. In front of the user, there is a screen showing current(sensing from 9DOF and load-cell sensor) and instructed angle and force. Before each trail, participants are requested to return the initial position.

% In each trial, after the participant indicated his readiness, one of the drawings in Figure 3 appeared on a Keynote slide. The participant was asked an eyes-free input, that is, not to look at his left palm when sketching on it by right index finger; also, the starting point and stroke order of each drawing were provided. The trial was completed when the participant finished the sketch and dropped his right arm to get ready for the next trial.%During the trial, the participant needed to wear a partial blind- fold modified from a sanitary mask to completely occlude the users view of his hand as shown in Figure 2.

\subsubsection{Motion Mode}
The accuracy due to chance was 10\%. Off-line accuracy was computed using 10-fold cross-validation of the evaluation data. The mean accuracy across all participants was 95\% (SD: ±2.7\%). If we only consider four swipe gesture, the system can achieved 99.5\%(SD: ±1.2\%). The misdetection is shown in Fig??, and the caused of the this due to the user use different posture angle for performing the same gesture.

\subsubsection{Motionless Mode}
The accuracy due to chance was 20\%. Off-line accuracy was computed using 10-fold cross-validation of the evaluation data. The mean accuracy across all participants was 85.6\% (SD: ±3.7\%). The misdetection is shown in Fig??, and the caused of the this due to the user sometimes perform postures directly using nail to touch the surface which caused strain gauges different value. We also run 10-fold cross-validation for our pressure value. It turns out that the device cannot distinguish the difference of slightly changes of pressure. The device only can distinguish the pressure level of difference with 90\% accuracy when it comes to 0.4N with 1.2N.

\subsection{Gesture Input}


% 做到像是筆tracking的部分，偵測角度加上移動方向
% Hardware: The envisioned form factor of NailO should be comparable to that of a commercialized nail art sticker. To achieve this, we are prototyping a flex PCB version of the circuit with an integrated electrode layer. The flex PCB will conform to the curved surface of the nail. The battery life is the limiting factor for the size and lifetime of the device; we plan to explore wireless powering options, to remove the battery and allow perpetual operation.
% Input and Output: Beyond including the gestures in Figure 7, with flex PCB we can prototype robust 2 layer electrodes, turning the NailO into a X-Y coordinate touchpad. Along with the addition of an accelerometer, we can expand the in- put space to contact-less gestures. The system can also be- come an output device with the addition of LEDs or vibrators.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we implemented a new novel interaction technique which use the strains as input. We also developed a device called \projectName{} which has the ability for exploring the strain from fingernail. The device for swipe gestures on surface can be ditinguished in a high accuracy(93.2\%). For the finger posture, \projectName{} can identify five different kinds of finger posture. The system is attractive for always-available input for surface around and unobtrusive.
% In this paper we present NailO, a novel nail-mounted input surface. The miniaturized hardware fits on a fingernail and wirelessly transmits data. We show that the system can de- tect gesture inputs in real-time with high accuracy (>92). Also, we explored interaction scenarios using NailO as a re- mote control in ”hands-full” or privacy-sensitive use cases. NailO also broadens input space when coupled with mobile devices. Further, NailO’s customizable features fuses func- tional wearable electronics and cosmetics, which appealed to study participants. NailO is our first exploration; we plan to augment other cosmetic extensions to continue our study of cosmetic-inspired wearable technologies.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
