\begin{abstract}
This paper presents \projectName{}, a sensing technique that detects touch interactions by sensing the strain on user's fingernails. Our wearable prototype uses 0.2-mm strain gauges placed in a 3x3 grid on the surface of fingernails, and uses machine learning to recognize finger postures, tapping, and swiping. We conducted a 10-participant study to evaluate the feasibility of this sensing approach. Results show that the accuracy for sensing among 4 finger postures with different pitch and roll angles is 82.4\%. The accuracy for sensing tapping and swiping in 4 directions is 93.2\%. We implemented two example applications using our \projectName{} prototype: 1) sensing finger postures on a smartphone's touch screen to access advanced functions, and 2) sensing tapping and swiping for smart TV navigation. 
% Since the device is always available, 

%We also show some example scenarios of using this technique for smart TV and smart watches for extending input area and dimension.
%applications such as quick swiping on surfaces around to control smart TV's or touching on touchscreen devices to enable different application short cuts.

\section{Introduction}
Recent works have seen new proposals for nail augmented devices in body-attached computing. Fingernails have been widely adopted due to its characteristic of lacking perception, being non-obstructive and the most promising place for easy installation and removal\cite{MagNail}. 
Moreover, device design as nail art has been proposed in previous works\cite{NailDisplay,NailO}.
We believe using nails as a mounting location has the potential to become a mainstream method in the future.
% TODO delete this sentence. but need for another? -- NAILDISPLAY HAS THIS SENTENCE

% These devices are designed to be non-obstructive, small, lightweight and no disturbing in daily life. 

% In order to increase touch screen mobility, nail is the place which widely adopted for input due to its no proprioception area. Furthermore, it is less disturbing and most promising place due to easy installation and removing\cite{MagNail}. Lastly, nail art is proposed in previous work\cite{NailDisplay,NailO}. 
% In our daily life, we use our fingertips for controlling smart devices and feeling the tactile feedback from surface. Upon on this, flat and smooth touchscreen has been proposed and widely adopted by users. However, touchscreen are not always available device and at most of the device can only have binary states for touching. 
% Fingernail has multiple advantages for body mounted-device.


% 一開始講在nail上面output的work
% 在結尾開始講在nail上面做input的work
Prior works on fingernail mounted devices develop schemes to  provide visual and tactile feedbacks.
NailDisplay\cite{NailDisplay} mounts a visual display on top of fingernail to show the content underneath the fingertip. Ando et al.\cite{NailTDisplay} proposes to put a small voice coil to control the tactile feedback from surface by changing waveforms. More than that, FingerSight\cite{FingerSight} implements a device consisting of a camera to extract environmental information. Previous research also demonstrates using nail-mounted device to enrich input area. NailO\cite{NailO} proposes a capacitive sensor grid on top of the fingernail to sense swipe and tap gestures.
uTrack\cite{uTrack} and FingerPad\cite{FingerPad} places small magnets on the fingertip, and uses a magnetic field to track finger movements. TouchSense\cite{TouchSense} uses 3-axis accelerometer to detect finger postures for switching different modes of input.
These works have proven the versatility of a device mounted on top of fingernails, yet have not explored the characteristics of a fingernail itself as a signal source.

This brings us to think about using a fingernail as an input property proposed in \cite{NailSense}, which senses force touch via computer vision.
Mascaro et al.\cite{Photoplethysmograph} also implements a nail-mounted device for observing changes in the reflection intensity on a fingernail. However, these techniques have only examined static input method. The movements sensing such as swiping we used in our daily life is not covered.
%movements sensing which leaves in question the recognition of swiping gestures.

In order to explore better sensing technique of nail augmentation, we aim to design a device that achieved the following designs. First, it has the ability of sensing simple gestures (e.g. swiping and tapping) on surfaces. Secondly, it has no restrictions on input area which enable users to perform gestures on surrounding surfaces. Finally, it should come in a light and thin form factor to preserve the unobtrusiveness of fingernails.
The proposed design will be a novel input device for increasing the mobility of touch interaction.

In this paper, we developed a prototype, \projectName{} shown in \autoref{fig:main}(b), utilizing a grid of strain sensors to explore the technique of using strains from fingernail as input as sensing part. For computing part, a shield for Arduino Nano board shown in \autoref{fig:main}(c) was built and worn on the wrist by user.

% 指甲擁有了
% Using body parts as an input sensing technique becomes popular research area in HCI community recently. It not only provides users control surroundings by simply performing intuitively gestures, but also comes as an always-available input device which lowers physical effort when user needed.
% Since the device is mounted to our body, it is important to be attentive for the comfort level which will determines the utility of the device.
% Many form factor of sensing technique are presented (e.g. wristwatches, rings, bends). However, using fingers to perform gesture on surface is already built in our daily life which is widely adopted by users and it is the most intuitive way to perform gestures.



% In this paper, we chose the fingernail as a input area which has no proprioception and the device on top of it can be easily forgotten by user. Furthermore, it is less disturbing and most promising place due to easy installation and removing\cite{MagNail}. Lastly, nail art is proposed in previous work, Kao et al.\cite{NailO} implemented a nail-mounted device to sense swipe gestures on top of fingernail with decorations at top layer.

% Previous research also demonstrated using nail-mounted device to explore new interactions. Hwang et al.\cite{NailSense} proposed a technique which senses the force pressure by detecting white region of fingernail using computer vision. Kadomura et al.\cite{MagNail} also used a magnet on top of finger to enable interaction nearby smart devices with magnet sensor. TouchSense\cite{TouchSense} used 3-axis accelerometer to detect finger postures to switch different modes of input. TapSense\cite{TapSense} use a acoustic way to identify the gestures that drawing on the wall.
% However, the interaction of the techniques are limited to particular sensing area such as the region that can sense touch or within camera site.

% There are also works to track 2d on surface. LightRing\cite{LightRing} used a infrared proximity sensor and gyroscope to track finger movement. FingerPad\cite{FingerPad} and uTrack\cite{uTrack} instrument the fingertip with a small (passive) magnet, and a second finger with an active device that tracks the finger by magnetic field changes. Althought these device are

% To explore better interaction of nail augmented device, we aimed to design a device that have no restrictions of input area which can enable user to perform gestures on surfaces around. 
% The proposed technique will definitely be helpful in enhancing the modality of finger interaction, and expanding the interaction space due to the gesture can be performed everywhere.(this should be changed as well because this is a copy from nailsense) Our prototype, \projectName{} (\autoref{fig:FIGURE1}), use a 3$\times$3 array of strain gauges sensor. The size of the device's height is 0.8cm and width is 1cm which is smaller than 1 cent of US dollar.
% Derived from NailO\cite{NailO}, we aimed to provide a technique that can sense a touch and swipe event on any surface around user, and explore a touch using strain features to distinguish different kinds of posture and swipe gestures. We implemented a nail-mounted device that can sense the slight strain changes from fingernail when finger touches the surface. By letting user perform gesture on surface, user can perform gesture more intuitively.

% Products such as nail art stickers and fake eyelashes are widely accepted as extensions to the body for decoration and self-expression. They seamlessly blend into our physical bodies when attached, and are easily removable. As people already wear these products for fashion purposes, we propose embedding technology into these products to extend their functionality and utility to interaction.
% To afford usability in the form of cosmetic extensions, three main design themes must be realized: First, the interface should be small and unobtrusive. It should be designed with technology that can be miniaturized to the size of cosmetic products. When worn, it should be comfortable to an extent its existence could be forgotten. Second, the interface should afford natural interactions. The interactions should be simple, intuitive and require minimal cognitive mapping, building on natural body gestures. Third, the interface should be appealing and easy to wear. Like clothing and accessories, the interface can be easily customized. The mounting and removal process should also be simple and similar to existing cosmetic processes. As no device exists that satisfies the above criteria, our work is motivated to do so.

In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We developed a nail-mounted prototype and explored the ability of fingernail's strains as an input technique. (2) We conducted two system evaluations in finger postures and swipe gestures detection. (3) We implemented scenarios to explore interactions.

% \section{Related Work}
% \subsection{Functional work}
% LightRing\cite{LightRing} provides an always-available 2D input on any surface. LightRing uses IR emmitter and gyroscope to acquire finger movements on any surface. IR emmitter is used for measuring the distance between the ring and the middle segment (middle phalanx) of the instrumented finger, and gyroscope is used for rotation rate. However, it need to correct for drift with a magnetometer for other longer interactions.
% \subsection{Camera Approches}
% NailSense\cite{NailSense} use camera to track the finger tip’s color change, and then guess user is performing the touch or released gestures (using OpenCV). The limitation is camera needed and the gestures need to be performed in front of it. AirPincher is a handheld device which provides eye-free input within fingers and support 6 kinds of gesture with tactile feedback. User can use his/her thumb to pinch, swipe, rubbing at index and middle finger, and the demo of surfing websites also proposed. Nevertheless, camera needed and need to hold the device, not always available.
% \subsection{Location work}
% MagNail\cite{MagNail} is a study that augmenting nails with a magnet to detect user actions using a smart device which allows user actions to be detected via the magnetic sensor integrated in smart devices such as a smartphone or a tablet PC. The limitation is the error rates is pretty high on the button of the device. NailO use capacitive sensing on printed electrodes as a input surface. It is small and unobtrusive, existence could be forgotten and it has a high accuracy. However, it can only support 5 kinds of gestures. 
% \subsection{Acoustic work}
% TapSense\cite{TapSense} use a acoustic way to identify which gesture is preformed by the users. They capture the sound when our fingers strike the screen, and use that sound pattern to recognize the gesture. This approach doesn't require user to wear anything, but will need a microphone which already built in smart phones. Scratch input use the sound when fingernail is dragged over the surface of a textured material as finger input surface. Six Scratch Input gestures at about 90\% accuracy with less than five minutes of training and on wide variety of surfaces. However, the interface table will not always exist.


\section{Prototype Design}
Few main design requirements were needed. First of all, the device must be small enough to fit within fingernail. Second, it should have the ability to sense slight changes of the strain from fingernail. Last but not least, it has to be reusable and easy for installation and removing. Thus, we concluded that using a 2D array of strain gauges is the proper solution for this prototype. To derive a general fitting, we conducted a 10 users (7 male, 3 female) pilot study to collect the average size of fingernail. The pilot study showed, fingernail width is 1.14cm (SD=0.14) and height is 1.21cm (SD=0.17).

%\subsection{Pilot Study : Size of Fingernail and Human Behaviour}
%We recruited 10 participants (7 male, 3 female) from ages 20 and 24 (mean 21) to find an average width and height of fingernail. We also requested users to perform tap gesture on electronic load-cell to measure how much pressure is applied on a surface to investigate the ability of strain gauges.

%The average of tap pressure measured 0.82N (SD=0.26).
% The changes of color on fingernail are obvious when we press pressure changes, 

% , trains from fingernail is 

% Physical changes on the surface of nail caused by finger motions and gestures on surface are visible to the human eye. However, there is still difficulty on detecting it through most sensing techniques because such physical changes are very small in comparison to that of finger joint movements. Moreover, physical changes on the surface of nail varies from person to person. Accordingly, we have two major requirements. First, a small and light device must be able to sense small physical changes. Second, a device must be able to extract individual information from multiple spots on the surface of a human nail. Among a variety of sensing techniques, we conclude that strain gauge sensors best fit our requirements for this prototype.

\subsection{Hardware}
Based on our pilot study, we developed \projectName{} using a 3$\times$3 array of 120-ohm 0.2-mm strain gauges for sensing part (Shown in \autoref{fig:main}(b)). 
% TODO check this before submission
Below the strain gauges, we used a stretchable and flexible artificial-skin to adhere sensors onto user's fingernail. The size of it only takes 1.0cm$\times$1.1cm which is smaller than 1 US cent, and the thickness of it is 1mm. Each of the strain gauge is directly wired to the computing part.
%TODO changed by josh until here
The computing hardware consists of an Arduino Nano board, two 8-to-1 analog switches(MAX4617, Maxim Integrated), a dual digital potentiometer (AD5231, Analog Devices), and two instrumentation amplifiers (AD623, Analog Devices and INA122U, Texas Instruments).


% hardware confirmed!!


The diagram of the computing hardware is shown in \autoref{fig:completeCircuitDiagram}. First, the multiplexers are sequentially selected to connect one of the strain gauges. Upon gauge selection, it becomes one of the four resistors on the Wheatstone bridge. When the forces are applied on fingertip, the strain of fingernail causes slight bend or contour which causes the ohm value to be lower or higher. Due to the changes of ohm value, one side of the voltage in Wheatstone bridge also changed. This difference becomes our sensing signal input.

  \vspace{-0.8em}
\end{figure}

Due to changes to strain being slight, we used two amplifiers to magnify the difference on both sides of Wheatstone bridge 4000 times. Finally, Arduino Nano reads the final analog value from the last amplifier's output. The digital potentiometer is used for adjusting the resistance to let the Wheatstone bridge have no difference on both side during calibration.

\section{System Evaluation}
In order to explore further interactions like movement gestures, we firstly wanted to exam the reproducibility of the strains of fingernail (Motionless mode). A further step, swiping gestures tested (Motion mode).
The goals of the evaluation as followings : (1) The reproducibility from different finger postures at user daily usage pressure levels. (2) Capability of classifying different kinds of swipe gestures on surface.

Since we need the daily usage pressure levels, we conducted 10 participants which are from prior pilot study to perform tap gesture on electronic load-cell. It was used for measuring how much pressure is applied on a surface to investigate the ability of strain gauges. At the end, the average of tap pressure measured 0.82N (SD=0.26).

We recruited 10 participants (6 male, 4 female) between the ages of 20 and 24 (mean 22.3). All participants are right-handed and drew with their right index fingers on the surface. Each participants received \$5 after one hour experiment.

\subsection{Apparatus} %設備！
The apparatus is shown in \autoref{fig:apparatus}. We used the same load-cell sensor (Error: $\pm 0.5$ grams) as used in our pilot study. In this experiment, we instrumented a 9 degree of freedom (9DOF) sensor on user's index finger. Since strain gauge is very sensitive to outside forces, we avoided contact between 9DOF sensor and fingernail, shifting it to the side of index finger as shown in \autoref{fig:apparatus}(c). The 9DOF sensor is only used for checking whether user is performing the applicable angle for collecting data. The surface we used consists of medium density fibreboard. The board size is 18cm$\times$18cm and thickness of it is 3mm.

\subsection{Task and Procedure}

\subsubsection{Motionless Mode}
In this mode, we tried a variety of finger postures with different pressure levels.
For each trail, the participants were instructed to adjust their finger pitch and roll angles which are shown in \autoref{fig:fingerposture}. A relaxing posture was added for keeping finger at the same initial position without touching the surface.
The forces are chosen from our pilot user study: average force (0.8N), one SD forces (0.6N, 1.0N), two SD forces (0.4N, 1.2N). The participants were asked to straighten their finger during the entire experiment. In front of the user, there is a screen showing current (sensing from 9DOF and load-cell sensor) and instructed angle and force. Before each trail, participants were required to return the relaxing posture. When participants adjusted their finger to the correct posture and performed the correct pressure (tolerance: $\pm 5$grams), we start to collect data. Once data is inapplicable during the study, recorder will automatically skip the data. For each user, we collected 5 postures in 5 forces for 5 times, which is total 125 trials.

\subsubsection{Motion Mode}
We chose four swipe directions (up, down, left, right) and tap for this study.
Users were requested to perform gestures shown on computer screen in front. On the surface, we drew a origin point and the end points for each direction to ensure swipe distance and angle are consistent. Swipe directions are randomly selected to show on screen, and collected with 10 sets of sequential data which contains a total of 80 trials for each user. A calibration is needed for the first time wearing but no further calibration was needed.

\subsection{Results}
%\textit{Accuracy:} is defined as the number of correctly classified samples divided by the total number of samples.

\subsubsection{Gesture / Posture Recognition}
We used LIBSVM tool\cite{libsvm}, a popular machine learning open-source library for SVM which is a way to distinguish the pattern by vectors.
Since the different type of the input data sets, we implemented two algorithm specifically for finger postures (Motionless mode) and swipe gestures (Motion mode).
In motionless mode, raw data is directly used for machine learning.
In motion mode, sequential and time based data is preprocessed by accumulating each data's difference from the first received data when the gesture began. At the end, the sequentially data is processed to be one feature data.
For each mode, we scale data's feature to the range of -1 to 1 and then train a multi-class SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.
\subsubsection{Motionless Mode}
The accuracy due to chance was 20\%. Off-line accuracy was computed using 5-fold cross-validation of the evaluation data. The mean accuracy for mixed all forces data together across all participants was 76.9\% (SD: $\pm$13.17\%), and the confusing matrix is shown in \autoref{fig:postureResult}. 
Note that most of the error happened at the relaxing state and angle of pitch 45 degrees with roll 45 degrees. For relaxing, strains were slightly changed at 0.4N and 0.6N pressure, it is hard to be classified with other angle classes. For the angle, we observe it is due to the user sometimes performing postures directly with fingernail instead of fingertip when the roll angle is higher. This caused strain gauges to have different values for each trail which raises this error classification.
The accuracy for each force level is shown in \autoref{fig:postureResult}, which shows that the higher pressure level the better accuracy gets. If we drop 0.4N and 0.6N data, accuracy can reach 82.44\% (SD: $\pm$12.74\%). 
%For sensing force touch, we used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate. However, it shows that average can only distinguish 0.4N and 1.2N pressure with 70\% (SD: $\pm$12.74\%) accuracy.

The mix-force leave-one-user-out accuracy was computed, which is low at an average of 55.2\%(SD: $\pm 13.6$\%).

\subsubsection{Motion Mode}
The result of this study is shown in \autoref{fig:swiperesult}. Off-line accuracy was computed using 10-fold cross-validation of the evaluation data. The mean accuracy across all participants is 93.2\%(SD: $\pm 5.98$\%). Most of the error occurred during swipe down and up gestures, likely due to the higher friction causing users to  perform gestures lightly on the surface which caused strains on fingernail to become less observable for the sensor. Leave-one-user-out was also computed, the accuracy was 44.2\%(SD: $\pm 12.9$\%) which indicates strains are significant different between participants.

\section{Example Application}
Based on the advantage of \projectName{}, we show two examples using this new interaction technique and are included in video.

\subsection{Controlling Smart TV / Devices}
% TODO Device
Smart TV's require us to take out the remote for controlling. With \projectName{}, user can focus on the TV program without the effort of taking out a remote. User can use desk as an input surface to perform simple tap and swipe gestures for switching channels and selection. Furthermore, we also implement this on smart watch. Due to the smaller screen, it is handy to use swipe gestures on the surface as an interaction method.

\subsection{Short cuts within application}
For touchscreen, most of the devices can only distinguish binary state of touch. Using \projectName{}, user can use different finger posture to enable shortcuts such as right clicking on computer. For instance, the file system on smart phone can be controlled with 45 degree of roll angle to show a drop-down list to delete, move, and change the file name.

\section{Limitation and Future Work}
\textit{Firmly sticker on fingernail:} In our evaluation of system, we noticed that the artificial-skin became not sticky enough through time and many times of usage. This caused the misclassifications in this situation due to sensing part becoming separated. We will continue to find another option for device fixation.
% TODO How many time?

\textit{Minimize computing part and Power consumption:} As shown in \autoref{fig:main}, we currently put the computing part on the wrist as a wristband form factor. The form factor is limited to Arduino Nano board size. This motives us to minimize the computing part into a ring form factor in future work. For the power consumption, we currently use 120-ohm strain gauges which can be replaced by much higher ohm gauges. 
% TODO check power consumption?

\textit{Force touch and Sensing from all fingers:} Since currently only examined the daily usage pressure level, the higher force will be our future work to explore the device's force sensing. More than that, mounting the device on all our fingernails is also our future work for multi-touch input such as pinch and zooming.

% TODO 可以討論多一點

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we evaluated using strains from fingernail as a input technique. We developed a nail-mounted device called \projectName{}, which is light and small enough to fit on top of fingernails. Evaluation of the this shows that it can distinguish finger postures on surface at average force level with 82.22\% accuracy. Not only for postures but also the swiping directions can identify in high accuracy (93.2\%). The system is also attractive for a nail-mounted always-available input for surfaces nearby which enrich the mobility of touch interaction. Our currently plans are to sense force touch and extend this system to all fingers for enabling multi-touch input.
%Evaluation of the this shows that it can distinguish swipe gestures on surface in high accuracy (93.2\%). Not only for swiping but also the finger postures can identify five different kinds of finger posture at average force level with 82.22\% accuracy.
